This is pretty much it at this point. BUT, you might wanna download some stuff in GitHub also:

1) Chicago95 - git clone https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95.git
2) ttf-ms-win11-auto - git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/ttf-ms-win11.git
4) st - git clone 
5) spotify-tui -
6) spotifyd - https://github.com/Shourai/st
7) We don't use dmenu here. You might wanna change that. Or install Rofi.

Hopefully everthing should be the same after your 69th distro-hop. Cheers!
